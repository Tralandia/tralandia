**`html2texy!`** is a converter from (X)HTML to the Texy! mark up language. It's implemented as an XSLT template and intended for use from PHP (uses a couple of calls to PHP-specific extensions to XSLT).

**[`Texy!`](http://texy.info/en/)** is a (yet another) mark up language resembling Markdown, Textila, or reStructuredText.
